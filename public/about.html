    <h3>My burning passion</h3>

    <p>When I was (more) young my dad gifted me a LEGO(tm)
      Star Wars(tm) Republic LAAT gunship, and with it's 
      construction I was instilled a deep unyielding passion for 
      building and creation.
    </p>

    <p>
      After many years and what I can only imagine to be an absurd amount 
      of LEGO(tm) sets, I "landed" a job (it was handed to me on a silver platter)
      as a farmhand with two of my closest friends on a farm down the road from my
      childhood home. There we physically <strong>destroyed</strong> ourselves
      dissassembling a grain silo and reassembling it at our boss' property. We also
      had way too much fun doing it.
    </p>

    <p>After a few years of rest from construction and broadening 
      my professional experience, I was recruited by one of
      those same friends from my days as a farmhand, and a new friend I
      made along the way to build some of the most beautiful patios and 
      retaining walls in Missouri <em>and</em> Kansas, with the pride in
      craftsmanship to build them to last.
    </p>
  
    <p>As of early 2024 I began building communications equipment for
      the Federal Aviation Administration. Although the pursuit of this 
      passion has introduced struggle, especially during the winter,
      it remains the best thing I've ever done not only for myself, but also
      for those that have believed in me and my ability to succeed.

      My desire to create and the support my family and close friends have
      graced me with are the things that have pushed me to not only make it 
      as far as I have, but to bring something completely new to the table, 
      and that's what you have on your screen right now.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having a joyful affinity for computer technology since not long after
      receiving the gift given to me by my dad, it makes sense that I would
      channel my passion into a space with virtually unlimited material and
      without the requirement of pain in my thoracic spine.
    </p>

      I enjoyed every moment spent building this page. You have my sincere
      gratitude for taking the time to read it, and my dream is that my
      contribution helps you in great ways in the days to come. By the way, 
      Dad, if you're reading this, the gift you gave me that I referred
      to in the last paragraph was immeasurably greater than a box of 638
      plastic pieces. While I can't say with certainty that I wouldn't have
      eventually figured out what I love to do, I feel proud knowing you're
      the one that gave me foundation. For this, I thank you the most.
